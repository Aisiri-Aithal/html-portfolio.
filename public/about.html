<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  
  Hi, I'm Aisiri G Aithal, an aspiring full-stack developer and engineer with a passion for both hardware and software development. I have a background in control systems, circuit design, and embedded programming, and I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning full-stack development and Python.
</p>
  <p>I enjoy the challenge of bridging the gap between hardware and software, bringing innovative solutions to life. My past projects include designing control mechanisms for projector curtains and lights, as well as developing a RISC processor for a mini-project. Along the way, I've worked with components like the IC 817 optocoupler and tackled complex tasks like frequency response analysis and stability studies using methods like the Routh-Hurwitz criterion.
  </p>
  <p>As I dive deeper into full-stack development, I'm excited to build dynamic, user-friendly web applications and further integrate my knowledge of embedded systems with modern software technologies. I'm also sharpening my Python skills, eager to explore its wide-ranging applications in web development, automation, and data analysis.
